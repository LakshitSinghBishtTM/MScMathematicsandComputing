# MSc Mathematics and Computing

A structured academic archive developed during the MSc Mathematics & Computing program.

This repository contains personal handwritten notes covering core topics in mathematics and computing, maintained systematically across four academic semesters. The material reflects classroom learning, self-study, and problem work carried out during the degree.

The goal of this repository is long-term reference and conceptual clarity, not presentation or textbook-style exposition.

## Organization

The repository is organized by semester:

- `semester-1/`
- `semester-2/`
- `semester-3/`
- `semester-4/`

Each semester directory may contain subject-wise folders with handwritten notes, problem work, and derivations as they evolved during study.

## Scope and Intent

- This is an academic archive, not a teaching resource.
- Notes are informal, handwritten, and may prioritize insight over polish.
- Content reflects my understanding at the time of writing and may evolve.
